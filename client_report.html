       <h2>Client Report</h2>
            <p>
                As the client, I decided on content and images by focusing on what best represented my 
                vision and personal goals. I wanted visuals and text that felt authentic and tied to 
                my story. Communication with the developer was generally smooth—we used chat and 
                occasional video calls, which helped keep things on track. There were minor delays 
                here and there, but nothing major. Overall, the developer met and even exceeded my 
                expectations, delivering a site that matched what I had pictured. In the future, I’d 
                probably set up more frequent check-ins just to keep everything tightly aligned.
            </p>

            <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
            <p>
                As the lead developer, I managed the team by breaking the project into smaller tasks 
                and assigning them based on each junior dev’s strengths. We used a group chat and a 
                shared task list to keep everyone on the same page. Communication with the client was 
                clear, and we made sure to provide updates regularly, which helped avoid misunderstandings. 
                Publishing the client’s site and sharing it through GitHub Pages went smoothly, and it 
                was satisfying to see everything live. Managing the repository on GitHub worked well 
                overall, though coordinating multiple pull requests took some patience.
            </p>

            <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
            <p>
                As a junior developer, I stayed in close contact with the team lead, who made sure I 
                understood my responsibilities for each site. I felt clear on what was expected and was 
                able to contribute to styling and content integration. I did run into a couple of GitHub 
                merge conflicts, but with help from the team lead, we resolved them. It was a good 
                learning experience in collaborative development.
            </p>

            <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                The most challenging part of the project was getting comfortable with using GitHub for 
                multiple team projects at once, especially managing branches and resolving conflicts. 
                I was able to overcome it with practice and guidance. I most enjoyed seeing the finished 
                sites come together and knowing we built them as a team. If I could do it again, I’d 
                probably start using a more detailed task tracker from the start. After this project, 
                I definitely feel more confident working on real-world projects—communicating with a 
                team and a client and handling actual deployment were all great experiences that will 
                help me in future jobs.
